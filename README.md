Protestant Bot is a software to monitoring Twitter by a bot and retweet them into a specific account, by our own API to
Twitter API.

## Why?

This bot were created to celebrate the 503rd anniversary of Protestant Reformation, started by Martin Luther in Germany.
The idea is retweeting every tweet hat contains some word or expression tracked, in Portuguese, about Martin Luther,
Protestant Reformation or related content.

## Technologies used

- Express, to manage API
- Sequelize, to manage database accesses
- Typescript, to develop this project

There are also very other technologies and dependencies. But tech above are the main used.

## Pre-requisites

This project needs the below minimum environment to run correctly:

- Node.JS 15 or above
- NPM 7 or above
- A database in one of these database servers:
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Postgres
  - SQL Server
- API and Client Keys from Twitter API

## Getting start

Create a database at your DBMS, with any name.

After, create a copy of `.env.example`, naming it of `.env`, changing the configs with your configurations. Below, a
suggested command to make it easy.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

So, when your config file were configured according to your environment, you'll execute the following commands, in that
sequence:

```sh
npm install
npm build
npm start
```

First will install program dependencies. The second, will build and prepare the project to be used. Finally, third will
start the API on port chosen at `.env` file.

The bot won't start with this command. To do this, execute, in another terminal, `node ./dist/src/bot.js`.

## Development

Protestant Bot uses TypeScript as language in development environment. To start development server, execute in your
terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Automated tests are under development. So, until now, everything could break ü§∑üèΩ. If you want, help us to improve this
(we'll use Jest).

After firsts tests were deployed, you'll can verify with command:

```sh
npm test
```

Please, note that command YET doesn't work. Have patience.
